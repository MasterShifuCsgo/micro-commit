finish global/sendAuthEmail.js

implement cors on your website

create a Toast for your login and register  and main pages, notifing when something went right or wrong. 

1. design is bad
2. login and register should show error messages
3. should refresh when user creates a new commit.
4. code is incredibly not beautiful to look at.
