finish creating the auth of the webiste

- create pages with react, no real design yet
- on page load, make it request an api endpoint
- create the api endpoint

resolveUser takes in a massive object res. make it so that it takes in a portion of it so it doesnt slow the computer down too much.

create documentation for every function
example: 
/**
 * Deletes a goal from the database.
 *
 * The goal is deleted only if both `goal_id` and `user_id` match,
 * ensuring that users can delete only their own goals.
 *
 * @param {number} goal_id - The ID of the goal to delete.
 * @param {number} user_id - The ID of the user who owns the goal.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the goal was deleted, false otherwise.
